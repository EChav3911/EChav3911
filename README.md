- 👋 Hi, I’m @EChav3911, but you can call me Edgar.  A middle aged guy eager to learn and take part in the world of coding
- 👀 I’m interested in learning computer science.  I'll be taking online courses for a software engineering degree at ASU, but I hope to learn and contribute as much from home as possible
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java for school, but I also hope to learn HTML, Javascript, and some Python along the way
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help with. I'm a blank slate for the most part. Anything I can do to help that will help me to learn and grow, and anything I can do to help others learn, will be more than appreciated :)
- 📫 How to reach me: echav3911@gmail.com
